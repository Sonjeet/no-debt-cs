<p>A CS degree from university has its benefits. But for those that want to learn at their own pace without spending a fortune, I've curated a list of reputable, free resources to learn CS for free.</p>
<!-- End Heading -->
<!-- Start Rationale -->
<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>With respectable institutes like MIT, Harvard &amp; co open sourcing their computer science material it's easier than ever to learn CS for free at your own pace. I've documented some of these resources in a structured fashion below but this is by no means a quick guide to become a computer scientist. These are demanding courses so put in the work pal.</p>

<h1>Become industry ready</h1>
<p>Theoretical computer science knowledge can only take you so far, popular choices for getting prepared for jobs and interviews are:</p>
<ul>
<li>missing semester <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">https://missing.csail.mit.edu/</a></li>
<li>cracking the coding interview</li>
<li>suggest a resource</li>
</ul>
<!-- End FurtherInfo -->
<!-- Start Credits -->
<h1>Credit where credit's due</h1>
<p>Although I have first hand experience in completing a computer science degree (with a 4.0 GPA ðŸ˜Ž)the inspiration for this site came from some awesome existing resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open source computer science repository</li>
<li>CS 4 Free</li>
</ul>
