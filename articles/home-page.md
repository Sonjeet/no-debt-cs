# No Debt Computer Science

A CS degree from university has its benefits. But for those that want to learn at their own pace without spending a fortune, I've curated a list of reputable resources to learn CS for free.

<!-- End Heading -->

<!-- Start Rationale -->

With respectable institutes like MIT, Harvard & co open sourcing their computer science material it's easier than ever to learn CS for free at your own pace. I've documented some of these resources in a structured fashion below but this is by no means a quick guide to become a computer scientist. These are demanding courses so put in the work pal.

<!-- Start FurtherInfo -->

Theoretical computer science knowledge can only take you so far, popular choices for getting prepared for jobs and interviews are:

- [The missing semester (MIT)](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)

Although I have first hand experience in completing a CS degree _(with a 4.0 GPA ðŸ˜Ž)_ the inspiration for this site came from some awesome existing resources:

- Forrest Knight's [Open Source CS Repository](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs)
- A similar website to this one: [CS 4 Free](https://www.cs4free.com/)
