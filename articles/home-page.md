A CS degree from university has its benefits. But for those that want to learn at their own pace without spending a fortune, I've curated a list of reputable, free resources to learn CS for free.

# Rationale

With respectable institutes like MIT, Harvard & co open sourcing their computer science material it's easier than ever to learn CS for free at your own pace. I've documented some of these resources in a structured fashion below but this is by no means a quick guide to become a computer scientist. These are demanding courses so put in the work pal.

# Become industry ready

Theoretical computer science knowledge can only take you so far, popular choices for getting prepared for jobs and interviews are:

- missing semester [https://missing.csail.mit.edu/](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
- cracking the coding interview
- suggest a resource

# Credit where credit's due

Although I have first hand experience in completing a computer science degree (with a 4.0 GPA ðŸ˜Ž)the inspiration for this site came from some awesome existing resources:

- Open source computer science repository
- CS 4 Free
