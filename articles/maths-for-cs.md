# Maths for CS

Stop asking if math is necessary for CS. It fundamentally is, so be sure to get good at it!

<!-- End Heading -->

<!-- Start Rationale -->

CS theory is powered by a **lot** of math. Every core module listed in this website will contain some level of mathematics and the goal of this section is to prepare you for those concepts. There are some math-heavy careers which computer science can lead you to:

- Formal software verification
- Machine Learning
- Cybersecurity
- Data Science
- Computer Graphics
- Game development
- Algorithmic trading
