# Intro to Programming

Learn a programming language, you know, the thing that lets you develop software.

<!-- End Heading -->

<!-- Start Rationale -->

Programming should be considered a tool that you use to apply your theoretical knowledge of computer science into practice. Having strong programming skills will open doors for:

- Software Engineering e.g. web developer, app developer etc.
- Robotics
- Machine learning
- Ethical Hacking
- _Anything else that involves coding_
<!-- End Rationale -->

<!-- Start Resources -->

Schools tend to introduce programming through either Python, Java or C++. Either language is fine for CS. I've listed the uses each language has in industry below.

- Java: Web Development, Android Apps, Enterprise Software
- Python: Web Development, Machine Learning, Scripting
- C++: Machine Learning, Game Development, Embedded Systems
