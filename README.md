A CS degree from university has its benefits. But for those that want to learn at their own pace without spending a fortune, I've curated a list of reputable, free resources to learn CS for free.

I've documented some of these resources in a structured fashion below but this is by no means a quick guide to become a computer scientist. These are demanding courses so put in the work pal.
